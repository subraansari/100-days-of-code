// Question 12: Greetings: Use the array from Exercise 11. Instead of just printing each personâ€™s name, print a message to them. The message should be the same for each person, but personalized with their name.
var friends = ["Areena", "Mehak", "Tabshara", "Laiba", "Bushra", "Alisha"];
for (var _i = 0, friends_1 = friends; _i < friends_1.length; _i++) {
